`usevoiceai` is the TypeScript toolkit for building end-to-end voice apps in a few lines. It is framework agnostic and splits into:

- Client: `useVoice` / `useAudio` hooks, a WebSocket client, recorder, and state store.
- Server: a transport-agnostic `VoiceSession`, adapters for Cloudflare Durable Objects and Node WebSockets, plus STT/TTS provider helpers.

With one websocket you get: mic capture → streaming STT → agent processing → streaming TTS back to the browser.

## At a glance

```tsx
import { useVoice, useAudio } from "@usevoiceai/react";

const { startRecording, stopRecording, status, audioStream } = useVoice({
  socketOptions: { url: import.meta.env.VITE_USEVOICEAI_WS_URL },
});

const { stop } = useAudio({ audioStream });
```

```ts
import { cartesia } from "@usevoiceai/cartesia";
import { deepgram } from "@usevoiceai/deepgram";
import { createVoiceDurableObject } from "@usevoiceai/server";

export const VoiceSessionDO = createVoiceDurableObject<Env>({
  transcription: (env) => deepgram("nova-3", { apiKey: env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY }),
  agent: () => new MockAgentProcessor(),
  speech: (env) => cartesia("sonic-3", { apiKey: env.CARTESIA_API_KEY }),
});
```

Jump to installation, pick a quickstart, and you should be talking to your app in minutes.
