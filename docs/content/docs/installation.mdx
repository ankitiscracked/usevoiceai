description: How to add usevoiceai packages and set the minimum env vars.
---

Install the packages you need (pick your package manager).

```bash
# React client
bun add @usevoiceai/react
# or: npm i @usevoiceai/react

# Core (only if you want the low-level pieces)
bun add @usevoiceai/core

# Server runtime + providers
bun add @usevoiceai/server @usevoiceai/deepgram @usevoiceai/cartesia
# Optional TTS provider
bun add @usevoiceai/hume
```

## Minimum environment

On the server side, set the provider keys you use:

- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
- `CARTESIA_API_KEY`
- `HUME_API_KEY` (if using Hume TTS)

For local examples, copy your websocket URL into the client:

```
VITE_USEVOICEAI_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8787/voice-command/ws?userId=demo
```

If you self-host, expose that URL behind HTTPS and require auth as needed.
